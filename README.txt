# CollegeProjects
This repository is destinated to all my college projects
wich are compiling and running satisfactorily for a considerable number of cases.
The main subjects conteined here are projects from:
- Object-Oriented programming (using JAVA)
- Algoritms and Data Structure I (using C)
- Algoritms and Data Structure II (using C)

IMPORTANT - I'm Brazilian so it might be confusing because some codes that will
be posted here are with variables and comments in portuguese :)
