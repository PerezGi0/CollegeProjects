# CollegeProjects
This repository is destinated to all my college projects
wich are compiling and running satisfactorily for a considerable number of cases.
The main subjects conteined here are projects from:
- Object-Oriented programming (using JAVA)
- Algorithms and Data Structure I (using C)
- Algorithms and Data Structure II (using C)

IMPORTANT - For each folder, I have a file with "description" on the name.
It is importante for you to read it first because I describe the all the code's funcionalities
and the concept I used to develop the code.

Note - I'm Brazilian so it might be confusing because some codes that will
be posted here are with variables and comments in portuguese :)
